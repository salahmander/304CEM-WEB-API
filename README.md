My stuff: classified ads web app (web API) 

For this project, I developed a web application that allows users to list items for sale. Guest can view and search items on the site but are required to register/login to see the full description and contact information. Registered users can upload as many items for sale as they want, specifying the item, description, condition, location, contact information, and an image to go with it. Users can remove items from the site if the item has sold or they wish to sell the item no longer. Items can be added to users favourites and removed if they no longer require the item. The administrator can view all items that are listed and can remove any item deemed unfit. This was made using React JS, Node JS and using an MYSQL database.
